- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @irenemao
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Product Analytics, LLM, Machine Learning, NLP, Data Processing...
- ðŸŒ± I served as a Data Analyst at Apple and my main work is to perform data processing using SQL and visualisation using Tableau to help other teams and clients solve business questions. I've designed, developed, and maintained custom Tableau dashboards, tailored to user requirements, and have effectively communicated key insights and trends to drive informed decision-making. One of my notable accomplishments includes using machine learning techniques to run regression tests, enabling the accurate prediction of future trends from time series data, resulting in data-driven strategies that have positively impacted our operations.

My background in Computer Science also provides me with a strong foundation in data processing and algorithm development. I've applied this knowledge to various machine learning projects, where I've not only developed predictive models but also translated their outcomes into actionable insights. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise to your team and drive innovation through data-driven decision-making.
